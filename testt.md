**Assignment 4**

Looking at the data I would give the bonus to the team as the ratio of errors has sensibly decreased from month to month.

As we can see in the table below the %o ratio decreased around a 40%. 

Month	Error	
August	16,44	
September	9,43	

Decrease of 42,62

Therefore we can conclude that the team has done an effort to enhance the ratio and this has had a significant positive effect on the data.

Further information about the calculation can be seen from the other excel file.
